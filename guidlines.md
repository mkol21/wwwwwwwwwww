# GAP Retail Database Population Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Maintain schema structure consistency and naming conventions
- Prioritize data integrity through foreign key relationships and constraints
- Ensure code compatibility and interoperability
- Frame solutions within retail business context (online, in-store, pickup)
- Optimize SQL queries for performance and readability
- Ensure transactional accuracy for inventory and sales data

## Implementation Notes
- Use `START TRANSACTION;` and `COMMIT;` blocks for all data insertions
- Include `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0;` before batch inserts
- Reset with `SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;` after completion
- Use proper ALTER TABLE statements to reset auto-increment values
- Maintain referential integrity across all relationships
- Generate data reflecting actual GAP products, pricing, and operations
- Follow logical business sequences for dates and timestamps

## Status Distribution Guidelines
- Orders:
  - 55% Delivered
  - 15% Shipped
  - 10% Processing
  - 10% Pending
  - 5% Cancelled
  - 5% Returned

- Payments:
  - 80% Completed
  - 10% Pending
  - 5% Failed
  - 5% Refunded

- Shipments:
  - 60% Delivered
  - 15% In Transit
  - 10% Processing
  - 10% Ready for Pickup
  - 5% Failed

## CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTE
ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: EVERY SINGLE FILE MUST CONTAIN A COMPLETE SET OF ENTRIES.
- NO ENTRIES WILL BE SKIPPED FOR BREVITY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES( DOES NOT INCLUDE COMMENTS, WHICH CAN BE REMOVED FOR BREVITY) 
- EACH FILE MUST HAVE THE FULL SPECIFIED NUMBER OF ROWS
- GENERATE COMPLETE, REALISTIC, AND FULLY POPULATED DATA SETS
- COMMENTS CAN BE REMOVED FOR BREVITY, NOT DATA

## Final Verification
- Balance inventory across warehouses and stores realistically
- Create logical promotion utilization patterns
- Test all data for schema compliance before submission
- Confirm EVERY row is unique, meaningful, and representative of actual business operations
